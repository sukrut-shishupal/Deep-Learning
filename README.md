# Deep-Learning

Deep learning is a way to make computers learn patterns from data using lots of stacked layers of simple math units. 

Just like a simple neuron from the brain, deep learning uses neurons (lots of them) to do mathematical calculations.

In biology, we know that dendrites receive the signal and carry it to the nucleus where the signal is processed and the action is taken. In computer science, scientists took the inspiration from this created a perceptron (single-layer neural network).

In biology, signal transfer occurs at a specialized junction called as synapse, through a process called neurotransmission. In computer science, once the signal is passed from input layer and an actiona is taken, the signal (output for that layer) goes into an output layer and is then used as an input for the next neuron. This way a deep neural network (multiple layers of perceptrons) is created. To avoid showing each perceptron every time, people use the name hidden layer, to justify that a perceptron is present there, which carries out function.
